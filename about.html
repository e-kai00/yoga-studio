                <p>Stephanie first discovered yoga on a blind date during her first year living in New York City, 
                    in 2012. While no second date commenced, she recognized that this powerful practice was something 
                    she felt drawn to explore further, and a force that helped her cope with her stressful day job as well 
                    as her body image. On the yoga mat, Stephanie felt connected, inspired, strong and embodied, and she 
                    wanted to spend as much time practicing as she possibly could.
