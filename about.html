                <p><strong>Emma</strong> is a yoga teacher and therapeutic movement specialist based in New York City. 
                    It's Sattva studio that made her fall in love with yoga and want to become a teacher herself. 
                    Teaching alignment, awareness of position and movement of the body is 
                    important to Emma as she believes these are the foundations to a comfortable life.

                <p><strong>Kelly</strong> has always had a passion for movementâ€”a lifelong dancer. 
                    Graduated from the Northern School of Contemporary Dance, she later decided to pursue a path 
                    that studied movement and function and how to help others improve their wellbeing and find a more 
                    joyful experience in their own bodies. Kelly works with the whole self, mind, body and spirit, using 
                    reflection techniques to guide you to a richer understanding of yourself.

                <p><strong>Stephanie</strong> has 11 years of experience in Yoga, 4 of which she has been teaching. 
                    She has come to accept the limitations of her own body and embrace and celebrate whatever does or 
                    doesn't happen each day - both on and off the mat. The welfare of her clients is paramount to her so 
                    the classes are very relaxed, happy and supportive. She believes in keeping her classes simple 
                    and accessible so as many people as possible can also experience the benefits, and joy, of a regular 
                    yoga practice.
