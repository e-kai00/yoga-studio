                <p>
                    It's so easy to book classes on the PureGym App or on our website by simply selecting your chosen
                    gym,
                    viewing the class timetable and finding a class and time that suits you!
                    If you are new to classes, let your instructor know when you arrive, and they will help you get
                    started –
                    all of our classes cater for all abilities, so you can work at your own pace.
                </p>
                <h2>What to wear</h2>
                <p>
                    Come dressed in comfortable, breathable non-restrictive clothing – remember,
                    our classes will get you moving! Don’t forget to bring a towel to freshen up and a water bottle to
                    hydrate
                    (we have water fountains in every gym to refill any reusable water bottle).

                    Even though these classes will be more dynamic, more yang in order to energise the body and centre
                    the mind and emotions, they will be adapted to each participants' needs. The evening classes will
                    bring in the yin element for a more restorative and rejuvenating practice, while preparing the body
                    and mind for a restful sleep. They will also include Yoga Nidra, either as a complementary part of
                    the class or as a stand-alone evening session. Please see the end of this document for links that
                    describe the different practices.
                    Beginners, intermediate as well as advanced practitioners are all welcome! By using variations
                    and alternatives of the asanas/shapes, the classes will be adapted to make it suitable for each
                    participant's needs.
