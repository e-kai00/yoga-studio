                <p>
                    10 days Yoga Retreat Session in Rishikesh is always the preferred choice. 
                    Due to the stunning natural location of Rishikesh with the divine intervention of 
                    holy river Ganga, it's easy to get yourself isolated from the hectic & polluted city life. 
                    Our instructors teach authentic and personalised yoga lessons along with detox and de-stress 
                    therapies irrespective of your age and experience. Uncover the stillness and calmness that 
                    flows in the deep inside of your body with our holistic Yoga Retreat Session.

                <h3>May Retreat</h3>
                <h4>May 09 - 16, 2022</h4>
                <p>
                    7-day yoga journey, you learn traditional hatha yoga, ashtanga yoga, and Pranayama techniques 
                    to breathe correctly, rhythmically, deeply, and slowly to promote inner peace and awareness. 
                    Meditation practices are also used to train the mind or induce a state of consciousness in students, 
                    allowing them to achieve not only physical awareness but also mental, emotional, and spiritual self-development. 
                    We cannot function at our best capacity physically or mentally unless we are in full, good, overall health. 
                    Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when 
                    it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline. But when stress lasts for a long time, it may harm your health.
